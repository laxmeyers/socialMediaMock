# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I am trying to accomplish seeing how to work with api's in vue. 
{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}
This application allows you to post things and like others posts. You can share you thoughts and views.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
This was to help me to write a vue application and help me work with api's. I have found one where I used them to grab random fake ads and also one with posts for a fake media.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}
I created pages where you see all the posts and can go edit your profile. they transition nicely by loading a different page. On the main page you can progress to older posts to see this only hot loads the posts and not reloads the whole page.
# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used api's for the posts and ads. I also used auth0 to allow you to login and out and create accounts.
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used vue which is a framework for javascript. This was nice as it made it easier to create sections and reuse them all over the project.
